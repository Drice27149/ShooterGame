todo:

* change projectile collision type from block to overlap [gg]
* implement play hit system, character should react differently for different attack(location, rotation) [done]
* impulse projectile begin, derive or not? [not yet]
* problem about floating in the air: [gg]
  * when montage is playing, character float in the air
  * current solution is create a new slot in which foot don't play montage
* Think twice, code once.
* The arrive order of replicated variable is not fixed, and can't be relied on.
